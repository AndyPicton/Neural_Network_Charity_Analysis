# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used the features in the charity_data dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Analysis


## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- The variable that is considered the target for my model is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column which contains a 1 or 0 for yes and no.
- The variables considered to be features for my model are every other column beisdes "IS_SUCCESSFUL".
- The variables that are neither targets nore features were the "EIN" and "NAME" columns, which were dropped.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
